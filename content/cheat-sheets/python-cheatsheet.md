# Python

* there is no switch statement.
* bools are capitalized True/False
* to iterate over numbers: `for i in range(n):`
* read one line from standard input: `input()`
* write one line to standard output: `print(...)`
* write without a newline: `print(..., end="")`
* functions and fields use snake_case
* classes should be capitalized.
* the null type is `None`
* `/` is floating point division, `//` is integer division.
* collections have no size or length method, use `len(...)` to check.
* if a collection is empty, it is considered falsy.  So to check if a list is empty: `if not mylist`
* a directory of python scripts is called a "module".  a bunch of modules is a "package".
* there is no private field, they just prefix it with an underscore.
