# Python

* To iterate over numbers: `for i in range(n):`
* Read one line from standard input: `input()`
* Write one line to standard output: `print(...)`
* Write without a newline: `print(..., end="")`
* Functions and fields use snake_case
* Classes should be capitalized.
* The null type is `None`
* `/` is floating point division, `//` is integer division.
* collections have no size or length method, use `len(...)` to check.
* If a collection is empty, it is considered falsy.  So to check if a list is empty: `if not mylist`
* A directory of python scripts is called a "module".  a bunch of modules is a "package".
* There is no private field, they just prefix it with an underscore.

# Gotchas
* There is no switch statement.
* Bools are capitalized True/False
