Shortcuts for moving around in ubuntu:

Requiring the least memorization:
* easiest and fastest thing to remember:
  * hold down the window button, it shows you many useful shortcuts
* switch through applications running on your desktop: alt+tab
* switch tabs within terminal, or web browser: ctrl+page up/page down, or use alt+<tab number>
* access the window menu for an application: alt+space
* access application specific menus: alt+F10, or alt + an underlined letter in the menu.
* launch a new application: press window button.

* resize a window:
  * when it is not maximized, type: alt+space, then r
  * use arrows to resize, then press enter
  * a faster way is to use alt+f8
  * if using the mouse, you can hold down alt and the middle mouse wheel to easily resize it.
  * another really fast and easy method is ctrl+window+arrow keys.
    that is great because it can quickly consume half of the screen on right or left.
  * F11 makes it full screen (not equivalent to maximize in some cases)
* maximize or un-maximize a window: alt+space, then x
* minimize a window: alt+space, then n
* move a window that is not maximized: alt+space, then m, then use arrows to move it, then type enter.
* recover a minimized window: just alt+tab to it.
* access the menus of an application: 
  * alt+F10
  * For some apps: hold alt, the menus show with letters underlined to open them.
* open a new tab in terminal: ctrl+shift+t
* open a new tab in browser: ctrl+t
* quit current application: ctrl+q
* cursor to start of line: ctrl+a
* cursor to end of line: ctrl+e
* log out of terminal: ctrl+d
* delete this line: ctrl+u
* move forward one word: ctrl+right, or alt+f
* move backward one word: ctrl+left, or alt+b

* copying text from a browser:
  * click F7 to turn on caret browsing
  * use ctrl+f to find your text, then hit escape
  * hold down shift and move cursor to highlight it all
  * ctrl+c
