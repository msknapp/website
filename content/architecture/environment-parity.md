This is one of the 12-factor app principles.  Essentially, your production and 
non-production environment should be as similar as possible.  Of course, it 
won't be possible to make them identical.  You're lucky if you can even get close,
but you should try.  It will reduce the risk of having incidents encountered
in production.
