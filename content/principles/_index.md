Writing software applications can be very challenging.  Following certain software principles can help a ton.
Your code can be maintainable and agile if you follow these guidelines.

Software engineers should not be devoted entirely to specific technology.  Saying things like, 
"I only develop in Python", or "I only want to work with MongoDB databases" is a ref flag.
Using certain technology implementations is far less important than following the software
engineering principles that should guide them.

Many of these principles are similar to each other, overlap, and the lines between them are blurry.
