There is a famous saying:

```
If it ain't broke, don't fix it!
```

The open/closed principle is similar to the motto above.  Once you have a working 
component of software, it is preferable that it is not changed directly.  Instead,
it should be possible to change its behavior without changing its code.  It's similar
to another software design principle:

```
Favor composition over inheritance.
```
